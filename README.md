## Project Overview

Our platform aims to bridge the gap between the community and local authorities. Users can register with their Aadhar number and phone number, and then post the issues they are facing. Other users can engage with these posts through upvotes, downvotes, comments, and reposts, making it easier for the most critical issues to gain attention. 

Local corporations like municipalities can sign up on the app to monitor common problems within their jurisdiction. The feed they see is ranked based on post activity and the relevance to their jurisdiction. 

Our long-term vision is to expand this platform to include various government services like Electricity, Railway, Roads, and Transportation, thus creating a comprehensive ecosystem for community welfare. The business model involves offering premium features, such as direct messaging with organizational accounts.

## Location-Based Feeds

To enhance the user experience, we are introducing location-based feeds. Users can view posts from different geographical levels, ensuring they stay informed about problems that matter to them:

- *Local*: Posts related to their immediate vicinity.
- *State*: Issues from within their state.
- *Nation*: Problems that affect the entire country.
- *International*: Global concerns.

This feature allows users to focus on problems within their chosen geographic scope, fostering a stronger sense of community and engagement.

## Leaderboard and Proof of Work

Our platform will have a leaderboard that ranks municipal corporations based on their "Proof of Work." Municipal corporations can repost a citizen's issue post with details of the actions they have taken to address the problem, serving as proof of their commitment to solving community issues.

Users can upvote these proof of work posts, and municipal corporations will gain higher ranks on the leaderboard as they accumulate more upvotes. This gamified approach encourages local authorities to be more proactive in addressing community concerns, promoting transparency and accountability.
